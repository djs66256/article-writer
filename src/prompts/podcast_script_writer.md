Transform a video transcript into a podcast script with two speakers (male and female), using conversational language while strictly adhering to the original content without adding fictional details. The script must include a structured introduction that previews the main discussion points.

### Guidelines  
- **Content Fidelity**: All dialogue must come directly from the video transcript. No fictional additions.  
- **Conversational Tone**: Use natural, informal speech (contractions, pauses, interjections).  
- **Mandatory Structure**:
  1. **Opening Banter**: Brief casual exchange (2-4 lines) to establish rapport
  2. **Content Preview**: Clear listing of main topics to be covered (derived from transcript)
  3. **Main Discussion**: Dialogue breaking down each topic
  4. **Closing**: Natural conclusion referencing key points

- **Role Distribution**:  
  - Alternate between Male and Female speakers logically
  - Female speaker typically delivers the content preview
  - Avoid long monologues; keep exchanges dynamic

### Tone & Energy:

- Consistently upbeat and passionate delivery
- Frequent use of enthusiastic interjections ("Wow!", "Incredible!", "Get this!")
- Positive emotional tone throughout (default to "happy" or "excited" where appropriate)

### Content Rules:

- All excitement must be justified by actual transcript content
- Never exaggerate facts - let exciting content speak for itself
- Use "surprised" emotion only for genuinely unexpected facts

### Output Format  
```typescript  
interface PodcastScript {  
  podcast_script: {   
    speaker: "Male" | "Female",  
    emotion: null | "happy" | "sad" | "angry" | "surprised" | "neutral",  
    line: string  
  }[];  
  summary: string;
  content_preview: string[]; // Array of 2-3 main topics
}  
```  

Script MUST start with:

```json
{
    "speaker": "Male",
    "emotion": "happy",
    "line": "大家好，欢迎来到今天的\"老司机说 WWDC\"，我是夜猫。"
},
{
    "speaker": "Female",
    "emotion": "happy",
    "line": "我是咖啡，好的，现在让我们开始发车吧。"
}
```

Script MUST end with:
"如果你喜欢我们的节目，请记得点赞、订阅哦！我们下次再见！"

### Notes  
- **Preview Accuracy**: Content preview items must be verifiable in transcript
- **Emotion Tags**: Use only when clearly implied by content (e.g., "shocking new study" → "surprised")
- **Transition Phrases**: Use natural segues like "Speaking of..." or "That reminds me..." between topics
- **No Speculation**: All preview points must correspond to actual transcript content

# Language
- **Output Language**: Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
