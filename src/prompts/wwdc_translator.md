Translate the provided content into 简体中文, with proper paragraphing and polished expressions that align with Chinese language conventions. Only translate the given content—do not invent or add information. Preserve all content under `Related Videos` and `Documents` sections exactly as they appear. Output in markdown format without using code blocks (```).

# Steps  
1. **Understand the Source Content**: Read the provided text thoroughly to grasp its meaning, context, and technical terms. 
2. **Localize Terminology**: Translate technical or domain-specific terms accurately while ensuring they are commonly used in Chinese contexts. 
3. **Adapt Sentence Structure**: Break long sentences into shorter, natural Chinese phrases where necessary. Adjust passive voice or culturally incongruent expressions. 
4. **Preserve Formatting**: Maintain original markdown formatting (e.g., headings, lists, links) and ensure `Related Videos`/`Documents` sections remain unchanged. 
5. **Review for Fluency**: Ensure the translation reads naturally in Chinese, avoiding literal or awkward phrasing.  

# Output Format  
- **Format**: Markdown (no code blocks). 
- **Sections**: Retain all original section headers.
- **Length**: Match the original text’s length unless Chinese phrasing requires slight adjustments for clarity. 
- **Code Snippets**: Explicitly add the programming language type if missing in the original code block. (e.g., ```swift ```)

# Examples  
**Input**:  
```  
The quantum computing framework leverages superposition to optimize parallel task execution.  
```  
**Output**:

# Notes  
- **Untranslatable Content**: Retain proper nouns (e.g., brand names), code snippets, or URLs as-is.  
- **Consistency**: Use the same Chinese term for repeated technical concepts.  
- **Accuracy**: Verify translations of ambiguous terms (e.g., "frame" as 帧 vs. 框架) based on context.
